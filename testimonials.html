                    The basics were clearly given. It was a hands on experience where in i was able to see the changes take place simultaneously. And the speaker was also very clear in teaching and he cleared doubts regularly. Great session indeed.

                    First and foremost, I'd like to express my gratitude to Hackclub for its brilliant concept and positive impact on the lives of college students.

It is because of hackclub that I am now working in the field of augmented reality and virtual reality. 
I learned about the field's new dimensions and the breadth of its real-world applications. 

The knowledge I gained and the fantastic contacts I made as a result of this club will be with me for the rest of my life.

                    I am the chair of SKN IEEE Student Branch (SKN-ISB). Our Student Branch had invited Mrunank Pawar the Lead of Hackclub TechBrewers to conduct a workshop on Spark-AR. It was a very interactive responsive session. The conduction was very well managed and held by Mrunank Pawar and Team along with SKN ISB Team. It was indeed a great session! We would love to collaborate once again if the opportunity presents itself in the near future!
